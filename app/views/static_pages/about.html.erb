	<h1>About</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		My name is Jeff Craig and this website is my attempt at improving the quality and availability of CWHL statistics.  If you have questions, comments, or just want to follow what I do, you can reach me via <a href="https://twitter.com/jeff_craig_" target="_blank" >Twitter</a> or email (ahl_tracker[at]gmail.com).  
		This website was born out of my other project <a href="https://www.ahltracker.com" target="_blank" >AHL Tracker</a> because the official CWHL website uses the same backend as the AHL so it was a fairly simple port.  It has all of the features that my AHL site does except player level shot data.

	<h1>Tutorials</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		If you're interested in learning about how to use the site better then check out my tutorials (they're made for my other project <a href="https://www.ahltracker.com" target="_blank" >AHL Tracker</a> but they apply to this website as well).  I'll try to add them as I go so that the site's features are better understood.
